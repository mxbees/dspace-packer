This major paper explores the role that settler colonization has had in the ongoing struggles of local Aboriginal communities in Toronto. In order to explore arguments for Aboriginal rights in the city, the main research questions that this paper addresses are: What does urban Aboriginal self-determination look like? What can a closer examination of Toronto’s Indigenous and colonial history tell us about the context of present day  urban Aboriginal struggles in the city? How can Torontonians move beyond the politics of relying on settler recognition of Aboriginal rights and towards a multilateral form of development on Indigenous land? By framing this paper around the argument that Indigenous sovereignty precedes - and therefore could not flow from - the politics of recognition between the Canadian and Indigenous nations, this project attempts to transgress boundaries that some might consider settled in Toronto.\n
As more and more individuals are moving to and living in cities, the mental health burden of illness is rising, having individual, social and economic ramifications across the entire population (Srivastava, 2009). This raises the question of how to prevent, mitigate or reduce the effects of urban stress on individuals living in cities as the population continues to rise.\n\nThis question was approached within the context the Credit River Watershed. 107 household surveys were administered in two contrasting urban neighbourhoods to discern the habits of respondents with regards to attending different types of natural spaces, and how relaxing those spaces are. These responses showed that overall, respondents found blue space, i.e. being near water features like rivers, ponds, and lakes, to be the most relaxing of all types of space, followed by looking out of windows at natural spaces, and private green space.\n\nFactor analysis was conducted on the responses of how relaxing different natural spaces are. This revealed four different factors within the data, which have been named “Self-Reported State of Mental Well-being,” “Wilderness and Personal Spaces,” “Designed Spaces,” and “Relaxing Activities.” These factors, excluding the “Self-Reported State of Mental Well-being” factor, were used in designing an Environmental Index of Mental Well-being (EIMWB), which could be used as a way of monitoring the impact of environmental management on mental well-being over time.\n\nThe information from EIMWB monitoring and other data about the effects of natural spaces on mental well-being could be used together within the context of mental health promotion. Due to the more subjective nature of data connecting mental health with the environment, mental health promotion has not been embraced fully by public health agencies, where most health promotion strategies arepositioned. Assuming that the requirement for hard scientific data will not be changed, alternativevenues within which to place mental health promotion should be considered. This paper thus concludes that environmental management and design within urban areas can provide a setting for environmentally-based mental health promotion.\n
This Major Paper provides a historical analysis of the formation and development of CARF-International, a prominent private accreditation body in the social and human services sector. Accreditation is a system of evaluation, whereby organizations or programs are reviewed based on an established set of standards, in order to become approved, or ‘accredited’. Private accreditation, and specifically CARF accreditation, has become mandated and recognized by numerous government agencies across North America, and often acts as a requirement for human/social service agencies to access government funding. However the history and evolution of accreditation, and specifically accrediting institutions in the social/human services sector is not well research, therefore the purpose of this paper is exploratory.\n\nThe paper begins with an overview of the literature on accreditation, accrediting institutions, as well as select literature on policy trends in public management, the welfare state, and transnational private regulation. The research is accomplished through a historical case study methodology that draws loosely on research questions utilized in previous research on accrediting institutions. I have identified three broad phases in the evolution of CARF-International: the foundational years (late 1960s to late 80s); building the market (1990s); and growth and expansion (2000s onwards).\n\nThrough the analysis I have identified seven key themes that relate the literature review to the evolution of CARF-International: the initial purpose of developing standards and accreditation; accreditation as private regulation; governance structure; CARF as a forum for debate; competition between accrediting institutions; the international ‘turn’; and program evaluation. One point of interest is the position of CARF in a governance network (or ‘infrastructure’/’assemblage’) that crosses traditional boundaries of public-private or local-global. A second point is the changing nature of CARF as an institution—specifically in terms of industry involvement in the governance of CARF—as well as the influence of increasing competition and pressure for growth on the practices of CARF as an institution. A third point for further inquiry questions the impact of accreditation on \nservice providers, and service delivery systems.\n\nOverall this Major  Paper offers an  in-depth look at  CARF as an accrediting  institution  as  a  means  to  expose  and  explore  trends  in accreditation and the broader field of social and human services.\n
"In expanding my theoretical and practical knowledge in fostering successful collaborative learning opportunities, my major project is an example of participatory arts-based action research. I was e nthusiastically inspired to incorporate collaborative design and an active painting process into this research project, as I have been an avid community-oriented artist since a tender age. I was able to enhance my range of skills through large scale set design projects, municipal banners, graphic design projects, constructive sculpture, advanced painting, and drawing practices within my undergraduate degree in Geography and Visual Arts at Vancouver Island University. I am an advocate for the diversification of cultural development to encourage creativity and to increase our perceptive sensibilities.  Individuals can achieve an internalized understanding of a particular area of study if they are fully  engaged in the process, thus making the experience more influential.\n\nBy conducting interdisciplinary research in the form of a literature review of contemporary agricultural development, environmental philosophy, and popular education theory, I designed my major project to concentrate on communicating the urgency of socio-cultural and environmental justice embedded within transnational food sovereignty issues. Raj Patel (2009) describes in the Journal of Peasant Studies how a heavy “technocentric approach could exacerbate current conditions of poverty and inequity” due to a concentration of “power and privilege” within a “narrow set of world views at the expense of pertinent local knowledge and socio-cultural and political specificities” (693). The rapid growth of global agricultural development and lack of transnational education pertaining to ecological studies has greatly influenced cultural development, consumer behaviouralism, and expanding corporate ownership. There is an increase in the fragmentation of ecological stability within agricultural productionawell as a lack of ethical responsibility within the cultivation, distribution, manufacturing, and trade practices. In providing participant questionnaires and facilitating a collaborative mural project within my research, this series of popular education workshops aided in expressing sustainable cultural and educational activities. The results from the workshops encapsulated the diversity of perceptions participants had of contemporary agricultural and ecological development.\n\n“They dreamed of an open, democratic education, one that would instill in their children a taste for questioning, a passion for knowledge, a healthy curiosity, the joy of creating, and the \npleasure of risk without which there can be no creation”(Freire, P., 2012, 122).\n\nPaulo Freire (1921-1997) and his work as an educational theorist, influential author, and philosopher, has been a significant influence in the expansion of my own academic and personal \nideologies. Upon developing this major research project, similarly to the progressive topics expressed in the writings on popular education and social justice of Paulo Freire, the purpose was to inspire critical thought, conversation, and creativity. I aimed to build cohesive interconnectivity, inter- relationality, and environmentalist phenomenological perspectives \nrelative to ' just sustainability'. The “crisis of sustainability”, as quoted by Robert Costanza (1987) in David Orr's Hope Is an Imperative, is more of a rational behavioural situation, a social trap, and a cultural avoidance tactic (Orr, 2011, 75). Additionally, Julian Agyeman (2003) within his text Just Sustainabilities: Development in an Unequal World describes just sustainability as recognizing vast societal inequalities with references to ""anthropocentrism”, “ecological democracy”, “feminism and gender”, “selective victimization”, “risk society”, “biocultural assimilation”, and “ecological modernization” (Agyeman, 2003). Just sustainability aims at finding a critical balance between environmental and social justice.\n\nThe organizational world we live in is structured and shaped into systems in all areas including our economies, governments, families, cultures, sciences, and individual selves. It is possible to transition from exclusive systems to more inclusive systems, where we can attempt to actualize our aspirations for “a fair distribution of power, human dignity, and a livable environment” (Merchant, xii, 1992). Within John P. Miller's (2013) text The Holistic Curriculum, he elaborates how our sense of individualism has “promoted the fragmentation as there is less attempt to define the common good, much less work towards such a goal” (pp. 48). Our world has become increasingly homogenized through the process of globalization, as there is a loss of diversity due to monocultural domination as opposed to ensuring the survival of “polycultural praxis” (Gonzalez, 2004, 447). It will require that our contemporary cultures value diversity, cultural sovereignty, and traditional inter-generational values. Within environmental education, to reach a deeper level of collective and collaborative understanding of these developmental issues we must embody the varying local sociocultural contexts, as well as the natural processes of the particular bioregions and ecological systems.\n\nI have also been inspired by a Deep Ecological critical pedagogy of self-realization, as described by author and Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess (1912-2009). Our goal is to enhance our collective understanding of the self, how we determine values, and what spirituality may mean in relation to one another, our communities, our historical nationalities, and our local and global ecological systems. Arne Naess in his interpretation of self-realization stated “the maturity of self has been considered to develop through three stages, from ego to social self, comprising the ego, and from there to the metaphysical self, comprising the social self” while incorporating nature and reaching the critical potential of the “ecological self” (Naess, as quoted in Drengson & Yuichi, 1995, 14). I aimed to include these ideals into a popular educational praxis in a participatory fashion through allowing participants to express themselves within the greater context of our environmentalist topics in a social community in the form of symbolism and artwork.\n\nThe structure of the design loom I developed aimed to empower critical educational dialogue with discussion-based action research and surveys. Topics covered include defining eight definitions: vCulture, Health, Globalization, Deep Ecology, Ecological Stewardship, Sacred Economics, Just Sustainability, and Agroecology (See Ch. 3.2 & Appendix E). The intention of focusing on these terms was to aid in discussing diversity within environmental philosophy, deconstructing the complexity of agricultural studies, developing personal-communal ecological identities, as well as engaging discussions pertaining to fostering healthy sustainable cultures and communities.\n\nThis research design was reviewed and approved by the FES Human Participants Research Committee on behalf of York University for the year 2014. I held two successful workshops in two locations in Toronto, Ontario in May and June of 2014. Participant involvement in these workshops varied depending on personal availability and one's desired contribution to this major research. Participants were given the opportunity to contribute to a group discussion, a 'People's Dictionary' popular education activity, a personal anonymously documented questionnaire, as well as collaborative mural design and painting. This study was completely voluntary and participants had the right to withdraw at any time. This collaborative arts-based action research project was an exciting activity to facilitate, as it gave participants an opportunity to share their stories and opinions, as well as elaborate upon their knowledge of agricultural and ecological studies while exercising their creative skill sets.\n\nThe content within the research interview questionnaire (Appendix C) was relative to each participant's personal contribution to the greater systems of agricultural development, their own moral value-based criteria associated with consumer products, dietary requirements or habits, and lastly if they had any relative practical/educational experience in agricultural production or ecological systems knowledge. Within rapidly globalizing urban cultures, an increasing fragmentation between nature and society can occur. More specifically, there can be a growing lack of transparency in relation to the origin, composition, and accurate social implications of our consumables, as well as to the integrity of environmental health. We are expanding our agricultural production rates, though the margins of inaccessibility are increasing: “Last year record numbers of the world’s poor experienced hunger, this at a time of record harvests and record profits for the world’s major agrifood corporations” (Holt- Gimenez, 2009, 143). There is an increase in transnational corporate ownership of agricultural land and development, consequently a decrease in diversity, an increase in demand, and a lack of proper equitable distribution.\n\nOur cultures and systems are continually evolving, this contemporary post-colonial developmental trend is due to “ecological imperialism”, a term coined by Alfred W. Crosby (1986), which describes the transformation of our physical, biological, atmospheric, and fluvial systems, as well as traditional societal structures and practices (Ashcroft, Griffiths, & Tiffin, 2007, 76). Similarly, the exponential rate of globalization has fostered an expanding global economic structure, while these developmental impacts have “perpetuated poverty, widened material inequalities, increased ecological degradation, sustained militarism, fragmented communities, marginalized subordinated groups, fed intolerance and deepened crises of democracy” (Scholte, 1996, as quoted in Ashcroft, Griffiths, & Tiffin, 2007, 111). Though we claim to be fostering values of social justice, there are barriers to equality and a diminishing sense of responsibility on a global scale. We continue to disassociate ourselves from the biogeographical origins of our ingredients and natural resources, as well as the labour force and communities who increase the opportunities for prosperity and sociocultural innovation in developed urban regions.\n\nPrimarily within my research, I obtained a substantial spectrum of anonymous data from my participant groups to assess the level of interest, intention, and awareness one may have of contemporary transnational agricultural and ecological issues. In a progressive lens, I aimed to inspire participants to broaden their imaginative minds and critical perspectives within the framework of an artistic practice. With literary, energetic, vocal, and creative contributions, I hope their experiences were positive on personal-communal, existential, and internal levels.\n\nIn fostering environmental stewardship and ecological literacy we are searching for “patterns, unity, and connections between people of all ages, races, nationalities, and generations” as well as between people and the natural world; embellishing a “tradition grounded in the belief that life is sacred and not to be carelessly expended on the ephemeral” (Orr, 2011, 260). As Gary Snyder (1990) once described in his article 'Ecology, Place, and the Awakening of Compassion' that an “ecosystem is a kind of mandala in which there are multiple relations that are all powerful and instructive”, while it can be described as hierarchical in terms of “energy-flow”, its basis relies on all entities as being equal and a part of a whole (Snyder, 1990, as quoted in Drengson & Inoue, 1995, 238). Our interwoven interconnectivity is a metaphysical and existential symbiotic system, similar to the sociopolitical ecologies we weave within the constraints of nature, therefore we must maximize our conscientious awareness of these intimate relationships.\n"
Food waste is increasingly being characterized as a prominent global problem. Along with the significant environmental and financial impacts associated with food waste, perhaps more troubling is the phenomenon’s global persistence in spite of worldwide hunger. Despite growing  recognition of the issue, however, research on food waste has remained limited and effective reduction strategies have not been achieved. \n\nThis paper contributes to the development of a comprehensive body of food waste research, conducted as a case study on food waste within Ontario’s domestic fresh strawberry supply chain for the years 2008 to 2012, inclusive. It presents quantitative and qualitative analyses of the occurrence and perceived causes of food waste, based on informationPsynthesis from a review of comparable food waste studies and surveys administered to supply chain actors. The recent removal of Ontario’s grading standards also provides a unique opportunity to assess historical assumptions concerning government grading standards as key mediators of waste generation.\n\nThe results indicate that 56% of edible strawberries grown in Ontario, by volume, are wasted through the course of the supply chain. The percentage estimates of strawberries wasted at each stage are: 15% during agricultural production; 11% during postPharvest handling and distribution; 9% during retail; and 35% during consumption. From a comparative standpoint, consumers are most contributive to waste, while retailers are least. The causes of food waste have been categorized into several areas: biophysical factors, technical factors, issues of mismanagement, regulatory factors, behavioural factors, and the dynamics of supplierPretailer relationships. In particular, increasing importP reliance and the dominance of food retailers are each of significant influence. Incremental strategies for food waste reduction and prevention are here presented in terms of the efficiencyPsubstitutionPredesign (ESR) framework. Overall, strategies addressing food waste are considered to be part of a more general transformative movement towards a food system that is ecologically sustainable, healthPoriented, and equitable.\n
With regards to community farms the Cavaleiro Farm design was approached as a multifunctional design with a strong patterning of environmental, social and economic layers of thinking. Natural education was explored through the development of the workshops and format for visitors to the farm. The innovative green business objective was an overarching theme to this design process because it plays such a large role in making the Cavaleiro Farm project viable. Resilient organizational structures were very much reflected in the social component of this research which of course is strongly interdependent with environment and business development for the project. Food systems, agroecology, food sovereignty and the complexity of our relationship with food have informed this final project. Specifically, various case studies, examples from working farms, as well as experiences interacting with others in the sector have been invaluable in informing this project as Cavaleiro Farm, where the project took place, is a real farm with real people.\n\nLearning organizations, particularly through the lens of systems-thinking and organizational ecology were the research areas that interested me throughout my masters’ work. The mechanics of how people work together on food projects and understanding how we come together through food in a non-hierarchical structure has been important since the beginning of the project. As a response to the profit-focused global food model, this project presents an opportunity to rebuild the local food system. Additionally, based on my work here, I believe that a democratically controlled local food system is the direction we have to go if we want to avoid similar profit-focused food in the future. Finally, triple bottom line business is a bridge between this capitalistic, profit-focused food system and the sustainable, accessible food system we are trying to build. Our current western world has been hijacked politically, socially and environmentally by a dominant class of the super-rich who over decades have accumulated more wealth at the cost of ecological and social damage. Farming and triple bottom line business presents an opportunity to rebuild without completely destroying the past foundations of modern civilization.

With literary, energetic, vocal, and creative contributions, I hope their experiences were positive on personal-communal, existential, and internal levels.\n\nIn fostering environmental stewardship and ecological literacy we are searching for “patterns, unity, and connections between people of all ages, races, nationalities, and generations” as well as between people and the natural world; embellishing a “tradition grounded in the belief that life is sacred and not to be carelessly expended on the ephemeral” (Orr, 2011, 260). As Gary Snyder (1990) once described in his article 'Ecology, Place, and the Awakening of Compassion' that an “ecosystem is a kind of mandala in which there are multiple relations that are all powerful and instructive”, while it can be described as hierarchical in terms of “energy-flow”, its basis relies on all entities as being equal and a part of a whole (Snyder, 1990, as quoted in Drengson & Inoue, 1995, 238). Our interwoven interconnectivity is a metaphysical and existential symbiotic system, similar to the sociopolitical ecologies we weave within the constraints of nature, therefore we must maximize our conscientious awareness of these intimate relationships.\n"
Food waste is increasingly being characterized as a prominent global problem. Along with the significant environmental and financial impacts associated with food waste, perhaps more troubling is the phenomenon’s global persistence in spite of worldwide hunger. Despite growing  recognition of the issue, however, research on food waste has remained limited and effective reduction strategies have not been achieved. \n\nThis paper contributes to the development of a comprehensive body of food waste research, conducted as a case study on food waste within Ontario’s domestic fresh strawberry supply chain for the years 2008 to 2012, inclusive. It presents quantitative and qualitative analyses of the occurrence and perceived causes of food waste, based on informationPsynthesis from a review of comparable food waste studies and surveys administered to supply chain actors. The recent removal of Ontario’s grading standards also provides a unique opportunity to assess historical assumptions concerning government grading standards as key mediators of waste generation.\n\nThe results indicate that 56% of edible strawberries grown in Ontario, by volume, are wasted through the course of the supply chain. The percentage estimates of strawberries wasted at each stage are: 15% during agricultural production; 11% during postPharvest handling and distribution; 9% during retail; and 35% during consumption. From a comparative standpoint, consumers are most contributive to waste, while retailers are least. The causes of food waste have been categorized into several areas: biophysical factors, technical factors, issues of mismanagement, regulatory factors, behavioural factors, and the dynamics of supplierPretailer relationships. In particular, increasing importP reliance and the dominance of food retailers are each of significant influence. Incremental strategies for food waste reduction and prevention are here presented in terms of the efficiencyPsubstitutionPredesign (ESR) framework. Overall, strategies addressing food waste are considered to be part of a more general transformative movement towards a food system that is ecologically sustainable, healthPoriented, and equitable.\n
With regards to community farms the Cavaleiro Farm design was approached as a multifunctional design with a strong patterning of environmental, social and economic layers of thinking. Natural education was explored through the development of the workshops and format for visitors to the farm. The innovative green business objective was an overarching theme to this design process because it plays such a large role in making the Cavaleiro Farm project viable. Resilient organizational structures were very much reflected in the social component of this research which of course is strongly interdependent with environment and business development for the project. Food systems, agroecology, food sovereignty and the complexity of our relationship with food have informed this final project. Specifically, various case studies, examples from working farms, as well as experiences interacting with others in the sector have been invaluable in informing this project as Cavaleiro Farm, where the project took place, is a real farm with real people.\n\nLearning organizations, particularly through the lens of systems-thinking and organizational ecology were the research areas that interested me throughout my masters’ work. The mechanics of how people work together on food projects and understanding how we come together through food in a non-hierarchical structure has been important since the beginning of the project. As a response to the profit-focused global food model, this project presents an opportunity to rebuild the local food system. Additionally, based on my work here, I believe that a democratically controlled local food system is the direction we have to go if we want to avoid similar profit-focused food in the future. Finally, triple bottom line business is a bridge between this capitalistic, profit-focused food system and the sustainable, accessible food system we are trying to build. Our current western world has been hijacked politically, socially and environmentally by a dominant class of the super-rich who over decades have accumulated more wealth at the cost of ecological and social damage. Farming and triple bottom line business presents an opportunity to rebuild without completely destroying the past foundations of modern civilization.

This major paper explores the role that settler colonization has had in the ongoing struggles of local Aboriginal communities in Toronto. In order to explore arguments for Aboriginal rights in the city, the main research questions that this paper addresses are: What does urban Aboriginal self-determination look like? What can a closer examination of Toronto’s Indigenous and colonial history tell us about the context of present day  urban Aboriginal struggles in the city? How can Torontonians move beyond the politics of relying on settler recognition of Aboriginal rights and towards a multilateral form of development on Indigenous land? By framing this paper around the argument that Indigenous sovereignty precedes - and therefore could not flow from - the politics of recognition between the Canadian and Indigenous nations, this project attempts to transgress boundaries that some might consider settled in Toronto.\n
As more and more individuals are moving to and living in cities, the mental health burden of illness is rising, having individual, social and economic ramifications across the entire population (Srivastava, 2009). This raises the question of how to prevent, mitigate or reduce the effects of urban stress on individuals living in cities as the population continues to rise.\n\nThis question was approached within the context the Credit River Watershed. 107 household surveys were administered in two contrasting urban neighbourhoods to discern the habits of respondents with regards to attending different types of natural spaces, and how relaxing those spaces are. These responses showed that overall, respondents found blue space, i.e. being near water features like rivers, ponds, and lakes, to be the most relaxing of all types of space, followed by looking out of windows at natural spaces, and private green space.\n\nFactor analysis was conducted on the responses of how relaxing different natural spaces are. This revealed four different factors within the data, which have been named “Self-Reported State of Mental Well-being,” “Wilderness and Personal Spaces,” “Designed Spaces,” and “Relaxing Activities.” These factors, excluding the “Self-Reported State of Mental Well-being” factor, were used in designing an Environmental Index of Mental Well-being (EIMWB), which could be used as a way of monitoring the impact of environmental management on mental well-being over time.\n\nThe information from EIMWB monitoring and other data about the effects of natural spaces on mental well-being could be used together within the context of mental health promotion. Due to the more subjective nature of data connecting mental health with the environment, mental health promotion has not been embraced fully by public health agencies, where most health promotion strategies arepositioned. Assuming that the requirement for hard scientific data will not be changed, alternativevenues within which to place mental health promotion should be considered. This paper thus concludes that environmental management and design within urban areas can provide a setting for environmentally-based mental health promotion.\n
This Major Paper provides a historical analysis of the formation and development of CARF-International, a prominent private accreditation body in the social and human services sector. Accreditation is a system of evaluation, whereby organizations or programs are reviewed based on an established set of standards, in order to become approved, or ‘accredited’. Private accreditation, and specifically CARF accreditation, has become mandated and recognized by numerous government agencies across North America, and often acts as a requirement for human/social service agencies to access government funding. However the history and evolution of accreditation, and specifically accrediting institutions in the social/human services sector is not well research, therefore the purpose of this paper is exploratory.\n\nThe paper begins with an overview of the literature on accreditation, accrediting institutions, as well as select literature on policy trends in public management, the welfare state, and transnational private regulation. The research is accomplished through a historical case study methodology that draws loosely on research questions utilized in previous research on accrediting institutions. I have identified three broad phases in the evolution of CARF-International: the foundational years (late 1960s to late 80s); building the market (1990s); and growth and expansion (2000s onwards).\n\nThrough the analysis I have identified seven key themes that relate the literature review to the evolution of CARF-International: the initial purpose of developing standards and accreditation; accreditation as private regulation; governance structure; CARF as a forum for debate; competition between accrediting institutions; the international ‘turn’; and program evaluation. One point of interest is the position of CARF in a governance network (or ‘infrastructure’/’assemblage’) that crosses traditional boundaries of public-private or local-global. A second point is the changing nature of CARF as an institution—specifically in terms of industry involvement in the governance of CARF—as well as the influence of increasing competition and pressure for growth on the practices of CARF as an institution. A third point for further inquiry questions the impact of accreditation on \nservice providers, and service delivery systems.\n\nOverall this Major  Paper offers an  in-depth look at  CARF as an accrediting  institution  as  a  means  to  expose  and  explore  trends  in accreditation and the broader field of social and human services.\n
"In expanding my theoretical and practical knowledge in fostering successful collaborative learning opportunities, my major project is an example of participatory arts-based action research. I was e nthusiastically inspired to incorporate collaborative design and an active painting process into this research project, as I have been an avid community-oriented artist since a tender age. I was able to enhance my range of skills through large scale set design projects, municipal banners, graphic design projects, constructive sculpture, advanced painting, and drawing practices within my undergraduate degree in Geography and Visual Arts at Vancouver Island University. I am an advocate for the diversification of cultural development to encourage creativity and to increase our perceptive sensibilities.  Individuals can achieve an internalized understanding of a particular area of study if they are fully  engaged in the process, thus making the experience more influential.\n\nBy conducting interdisciplinary research in the form of a literature review of contemporary agricultural development, environmental philosophy, and popular education theory, I designed my major project to concentrate on communicating the urgency of socio-cultural and environmental justice embedded within transnational food sovereignty issues. Raj Patel (2009) describes in the Journal of Peasant Studies how a heavy “technocentric approach could exacerbate current conditions of poverty and inequity” due to a concentration of “power and privilege” within a “narrow set of world views at the expense of pertinent local knowledge and socio-cultural and political specificities” (693). The rapid growth of global agricultural development and lack of transnational education pertaining to ecological studies has greatly influenced cultural development, consumer behaviouralism, and expanding corporate ownership. There is an increase in the fragmentation of ecological stability within agricultural productionawell as a lack of ethical responsibility within the cultivation, distribution, manufacturing, and trade practices. In providing participant questionnaires and facilitating a collaborative mural project within my research, this series of popular education workshops aided in expressing sustainable cultural and educational activities. The results from the workshops encapsulated the diversity of perceptions participants had of contemporary agricultural and ecological development.\n\n“They dreamed of an open, democratic education, one that would instill in their children a taste for questioning, a passion for knowledge, a healthy curiosity, the joy of creating, and the \npleasure of risk without which there can be no creation”(Freire, P., 2012, 122).\n\nPaulo Freire (1921-1997) and his work as an educational theorist, influential author, and philosopher, has been a significant influence in the expansion of my own academic and personal \nideologies. Upon developing this major research project, similarly to the progressive topics expressed in the writings on popular education and social justice of Paulo Freire, the purpose was to inspire critical thought, conversation, and creativity. I aimed to build cohesive interconnectivity, inter- relationality, and environmentalist phenomenological perspectives \nrelative to ' just sustainability'. The “crisis of sustainability”, as quoted by Robert Costanza (1987) in David Orr's Hope Is an Imperative, is more of a rational behavioural situation, a social trap, and a cultural avoidance tactic (Orr, 2011, 75). Additionally, Julian Agyeman (2003) within his text Just Sustainabilities: Development in an Unequal World describes just sustainability as recognizing vast societal inequalities with references to ""anthropocentrism”, “ecological democracy”, “feminism and gender”, “selective victimization”, “risk society”, “biocultural assimilation”, and “ecological modernization” (Agyeman, 2003). Just sustainability aims at finding a critical balance between environmental and social justice.\n\nThe organizational world we live in is structured and shaped into systems in all areas including our economies, governments, families, cultures, sciences, and individual selves. It is possible to transition from exclusive systems to more inclusive systems, where we can attempt to actualize our aspirations for “a fair distribution of power, human dignity, and a livable environment” (Merchant, xii, 1992). Within John P. Miller's (2013) text The Holistic Curriculum, he elaborates how our sense of individualism has “promoted the fragmentation as there is less attempt to define the common good, much less work towards such a goal” (pp. 48). Our world has become increasingly homogenized through the process of globalization, as there is a loss of diversity due to monocultural domination as opposed to ensuring the survival of “polycultural praxis” (Gonzalez, 2004, 447). It will require that our contemporary cultures value diversity, cultural sovereignty, and traditional inter-generational values. Within environmental education, to reach a deeper level of collective and collaborative understanding of these developmental issues we must embody the varying local sociocultural contexts, as well as the natural processes of the particular bioregions and ecological systems.\n\nI have also been inspired by a Deep Ecological critical pedagogy of self-realization, as described by author and Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess (1912-2009). Our goal is to enhance our collective understanding of the self, how we determine values, and what spirituality may mean in relation to one another, our communities, our historical nationalities, and our local and global ecological systems. Arne Naess in his interpretation of self-realization stated “the maturity of self has been considered to develop through three stages, from ego to social self, comprising the ego, and from there to the metaphysical self, comprising the social self” while incorporating nature and reaching the critical potential of the “ecological self” (Naess, as quoted in Drengson & Yuichi, 1995, 14). I aimed to include these ideals into a popular educational praxis in a participatory fashion through allowing participants to express themselves within the greater context of our environmentalist topics in a social community in the form of symbolism and artwork.\n\nThe structure of the design loom I developed aimed to empower critical educational dialogue with discussion-based action research and surveys. Topics covered include defining eight definitions: vCulture, Health, Globalization, Deep Ecology, Ecological Stewardship, Sacred Economics, Just Sustainability, and Agroecology (See Ch. 3.2 & Appendix E). The intention of focusing on these terms was to aid in discussing diversity within environmental philosophy, deconstructing the complexity of agricultural studies, developing personal-communal ecological identities, as well as engaging discussions pertaining to fostering healthy sustainable cultures and communities.\n\nThis research design was reviewed and approved by the FES Human Participants Research Committee on behalf of York University for the year 2014. I held two successful workshops in two locations in Toronto, Ontario in May and June of 2014. Participant involvement in these workshops varied depending on personal availability and one's desired contribution to this major research. Participants were given the opportunity to contribute to a group discussion, a 'People's Dictionary' popular education activity, a personal anonymously documented questionnaire, as well as collaborative mural design and painting. This study was completely voluntary and participants had the right to withdraw at any time. This collaborative arts-based action research project was an exciting activity to facilitate, as it gave participants an opportunity to share their stories and opinions, as well as elaborate upon their knowledge of agricultural and ecological studies while exercising their creative skill sets.\n\nThe content within the research interview questionnaire (Appendix C) was relative to each participant's personal contribution to the greater systems of agricultural development, their own moral value-based criteria associated with consumer products, dietary requirements or habits, and lastly if they had any relative practical/educational experience in agricultural production or ecological systems knowledge. Within rapidly globalizing urban cultures, an increasing fragmentation between nature and society can occur. More specifically, there can be a growing lack of transparency in relation to the origin, composition, and accurate social implications of our consumables, as well as to the integrity of environmental health. We are expanding our agricultural production rates, though the margins of inaccessibility are increasing: “Last year record numbers of the world’s poor experienced hunger, this at a time of record harvests and record profits for the world’s major agrifood corporations” (Holt- Gimenez, 2009, 143). There is an increase in transnational corporate ownership of agricultural land and development, consequently a decrease in diversity, an increase in demand, and a lack of proper equitable distribution.\n\nOur cultures and systems are continually evolving, this contemporary post-colonial developmental trend is due to “ecological imperialism”, a term coined by Alfred W. Crosby (1986), which describes the transformation of our physical, biological, atmospheric, and fluvial systems, as well as traditional societal structures and practices (Ashcroft, Griffiths, & Tiffin, 2007, 76). Similarly, the exponential rate of globalization has fostered an expanding global economic structure, while these developmental impacts have “perpetuated poverty, widened material inequalities, increased ecological degradation, sustained militarism, fragmented communities, marginalized subordinated groups, fed intolerance and deepened crises of democracy” (Scholte, 1996, as quoted in Ashcroft, Griffiths, & Tiffin, 2007, 111). Though we claim to be fostering values of social justice, there are barriers to equality and a diminishing sense of responsibility on a global scale. We continue to disassociate ourselves from the biogeographical origins of our ingredients and natural resources, as well as the labour force and communities who increase the opportunities for prosperity and sociocultural innovation in developed urban regions.\n\nPrimarily within my research, I obtained a substantial spectrum of anonymous data from my participant groups to assess the level of interest, intention, and awareness one may have of contemporary transnational agricultural and ecological issues. In a progressive lens, I aimed to inspire participants to broaden their imaginative minds and critical perspectives within the framework of an artistic practice. With literary, energetic, vocal, and creative contributions, I hope their experiences were positive on personal-communal, existential, and internal levels.\n\nIn fostering environmental stewardship and ecological literacy we are searching for “patterns, unity, and connections between people of all ages, races, nationalities, and generations” as well as between people and the natural world; embellishing a “tradition grounded in the belief that life is sacred and not to be carelessly expended on the ephemeral” (Orr, 2011, 260). As Gary Snyder (1990) once described in his article 'Ecology, Place, and the Awakening of Compassion' that an “ecosystem is a kind of mandala in which there are multiple relations that are all powerful and instructive”, while it can be described as hierarchical in terms of “energy-flow”, its basis relies on all entities as being equal and a part of a whole (Snyder, 1990, as quoted in Drengson & Inoue, 1995, 238). Our interwoven interconnectivity is a metaphysical and existential symbiotic system, similar to the sociopolitical ecologies we weave within the constraints of nature, therefore we must maximize our conscientious awareness of these intimate relationships.\n"

As more and more individuals are moving to and living in cities, the mental health burden of illness is rising, having individual, social and economic ramifications across the entire population (Srivastava, 2009). This raises the question of how to prevent, mitigate or reduce the effects of urban stress on individuals living in cities as the population continues to rise.\n\nThis question was approached within the context the Credit River Watershed. 107 household surveys were administered in two contrasting urban neighbourhoods to discern the habits of respondents with regards to attending different types of natural spaces, and how relaxing those spaces are. These responses showed that overall, respondents found blue space, i.e. being near water features like rivers, ponds, and lakes, to be the most relaxing of all types of space, followed by looking out of windows at natural spaces, and private green space.\n\nFactor analysis was conducted on the responses of how relaxing different natural spaces are. This revealed four different factors within the data, which have been named “Self-Reported State of Mental Well-being,” “Wilderness and Personal Spaces,” “Designed Spaces,” and “Relaxing Activities.” These factors, excluding the “Self-Reported State of Mental Well-being” factor, were used in designing an Environmental Index of Mental Well-being (EIMWB), which could be used as a way of monitoring the impact of environmental management on mental well-being over time.\n\nThe information from EIMWB monitoring and other data about the effects of natural spaces on mental well-being could be used together within the context of mental health promotion. Due to the more subjective nature of data connecting mental health with the environment, mental health promotion has not been embraced fully by public health agencies, where most health promotion strategies arepositioned. Assuming that the requirement for hard scientific data will not be changed, alternativevenues within which to place mental health promotion should be considered. This paper thus concludes that environmental management and design within urban areas can provide a setting for environmentally-based mental health promotion.\n

Our world has become increasingly homogenized through the process of globalization, as there is a loss of diversity due to monocultural domination as opposed to ensuring the survival of “polycultural praxis” (Gonzalez, 2004, 447). It will require that our contemporary cultures value diversity, cultural sovereignty, and traditional inter-generational values. Within environmental education, to reach a deeper level of collective and collaborative understanding of these developmental issues we must embody the varying local sociocultural contexts, as well as the natural processes of the particular bioregions and ecological systems.\n\nI have also been inspired by a Deep Ecological critical pedagogy of self-realization, as described by author and Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess (1912-2009). Our goal is to enhance our collective understanding of the self, how we determine values, and what spirituality may mean in relation to one another, our communities, our historical nationalities, and our local and global ecological systems. Arne Naess in his interpretation of self-realization stated “the maturity of self has been considered to develop through three stages, from ego to social self, comprising the ego, and from there to the metaphysical self, comprising the social self” while incorporating nature and reaching the critical potential of the “ecological self” (Naess, as quoted in Drengson & Yuichi, 1995, 14). I aimed to include these ideals into a popular educational praxis in a participatory fashion through allowing participants to express themselves within the greater context of our environmentalist topics in a social community in the form of symbolism and artwork.\n\nThe structure of the design loom I developed aimed to empower critical educational dialogue with discussion-based action research and surveys. Topics covered include defining eight definitions: vCulture, Health, Globalization, Deep Ecology, Ecological Stewardship, Sacred Economics, Just Sustainability, and Agroecology (See Ch. 3.2 & Appendix E). The intention of focusing on these terms was to aid in discussing diversity within environmental philosophy, deconstructing the complexity of agricultural studies, developing personal-communal ecological identities, as well as engaging discussions pertaining to fostering healthy sustainable cultures and communities.\n\nThis research design was reviewed and approved by the FES Human Participants Research Committee on behalf of York University for the year 2014. I held two successful workshops in two locations in Toronto, Ontario in May and June of 2014. Participant involvement in these workshops varied depending on personal availability and one's desired contribution to this major research. Participants were given the opportunity to contribute to a group discussion, a 'People's Dictionary' popular education activity, a personal anonymously documented questionnaire, as well as collaborative mural design and painting. This study was completely voluntary and participants had the right to withdraw at any time. This collaborative arts-based action research project was an exciting activity to facilitate, as it gave participants an opportunity to share their stories and opinions, as well as elaborate upon their knowledge of agricultural and ecological studies while exercising their creative skill sets.\n\nThe content within the research interview questionnaire (Appendix C) was relative to each participant's personal contribution to the greater systems of agricultural development, their own moral value-based criteria associated with consumer products, dietary requirements or habits, and lastly if they had any relative practical/educational experience in agricultural production or ecological systems knowledge. Within rapidly globalizing urban cultures, an increasing fragmentation between nature and society can occur. More specifically, there can be a growing lack of transparency in relation to the origin, composition, and accurate social implications of our consumables, as well as to the integrity of environmental health. We are expanding our agricultural production rates, though the margins of inaccessibility are increasing: “Last year record numbers of the world’s poor experienced hunger, this at a time of record harvests and record profits for the world’s major agrifood corporations” (Holt- Gimenez, 2009, 143). There is an increase in transnational corporate ownership of agricultural land and development, consequently a decrease in diversity, an increase in demand, and a lack of proper equitable distribution.\n\nOur cultures and systems are continually evolving, this contemporary post-colonial developmental trend is due to “ecological imperialism”, a term coined by Alfred W. Crosby (1986), which describes the transformation of our physical, biological, atmospheric, and fluvial systems, as well as traditional societal structures and practices (Ashcroft, Griffiths, & Tiffin, 2007, 76). Similarly, the exponential rate of globalization has fostered an expanding global economic structure, while these developmental impacts have “perpetuated poverty, widened material inequalities, increased ecological degradation, sustained militarism, fragmented communities, marginalized subordinated groups, fed intolerance and deepened crises of democracy” (Scholte, 1996, as quoted in Ashcroft, Griffiths, & Tiffin, 2007, 111). Though we claim to be fostering values of social justice, there are barriers to equality and a diminishing sense of responsibility on a global scale. We continue to disassociate ourselves from the biogeographical origins of our ingredients and natural resources, as well as the labour force and communities who increase the opportunities for prosperity and sociocultural innovation in developed urban regions.\n\nPrimarily within my research, I obtained a substantial spectrum of anonymous data from my participant groups to assess the level of interest, intention, and awareness one may have of contemporary transnational agricultural and ecological issues. In a progressive lens, I aimed to inspire participants to broaden their imaginative minds and critical perspectives within the framework of an artistic practice. With literary, energetic, vocal, and creative contributions, I hope their experiences were positive on personal-communal, existential, and internal levels.\n\nIn fostering environmental stewardship and ecological literacy we are searching for “patterns, unity, and connections between people of all ages, races, nationalities, and generations” as well as between people and the natural world; embellishing a “tradition grounded in the belief that life is sacred and not to be carelessly expended on the ephemeral” (Orr, 2011, 260). As Gary Snyder (1990) once described in his article 'Ecology, Place, and the Awakening of Compassion' that an “ecosystem is a kind of mandala in which there are multiple relations that are all powerful and instructive”, while it can be described as hierarchical in terms of “energy-flow”, its basis relies on all entities as being equal and a part of a whole (Snyder, 1990, as quoted in Drengson & Inoue, 1995, 238). Our interwoven interconnectivity is a metaphysical and existential symbiotic system, similar to the sociopolitical ecologies we weave within the constraints of nature, therefore we must maximize our conscientious awareness of these intimate relationships.\n"
Food waste is increasingly being characterized as a prominent global problem. Along with the significant environmental and financial impacts associated with food waste, perhaps more troubling is the phenomenon’s global persistence in spite of worldwide hunger. Despite growing  recognition of the issue, however, research on food waste has remained limited and effective reduction strategies have not been achieved. \n\nThis paper contributes to the development of a comprehensive body of food waste research, conducted as a case study on food waste within Ontario’s domestic fresh strawberry supply chain for the years 2008 to 2012, inclusive. It presents quantitative and qualitative analyses of the occurrence and perceived causes of food waste, based on informationPsynthesis from a review of comparable food waste studies and surveys administered to supply chain actors. The recent removal of Ontario’s grading standards also provides a unique opportunity to assess historical assumptions concerning government grading standards as key mediators of waste generation.\n\nThe results indicate that 56% of edible strawberries grown in Ontario, by volume, are wasted through the course of the supply chain. The percentage estimates of strawberries wasted at each stage are: 15% during agricultural production; 11% during postPharvest handling and distribution; 9% during retail; and 35% during consumption. From a comparative standpoint, consumers are most contributive to waste, while retailers are least. The causes of food waste have been categorized into several areas: biophysical factors, technical factors, issues of mismanagement, regulatory factors, behavioural factors, and the dynamics of supplierPretailer relationships. In particular, increasing importP reliance and the dominance of food retailers are each of significant influence. Incremental strategies for food waste reduction and prevention are here presented in terms of the efficiencyPsubstitutionPredesign (ESR) framework. Overall, strategies addressing food waste are considered to be part of a more general transformative movement towards a food system that is ecologically sustainable, healthPoriented, and equitable.\n
With regards to community farms the Cavaleiro Farm design was approached as a multifunctional design with a strong patterning of environmental, social and economic layers of thinking. Natural education was explored through the development of the workshops and format for visitors to the farm. The innovative green business objective was an overarching theme to this design process because it plays such a large role in making the Cavaleiro Farm project viable. Resilient organizational structures were very much reflected in the social component of this research which of course is strongly interdependent with environment and business development for the project. Food systems, agroecology, food sovereignty and the complexity of our relationship with food have informed this final project. Specifically, various case studies, examples from working farms, as well as experiences interacting with others in the sector have been invaluable in informing this project as Cavaleiro Farm, where the project took place, is a real farm with real people.\n\nLearning organizations, particularly through the lens of systems-thinking and organizational ecology were the research areas that interested me throughout my masters’ work. The mechanics of how people work together on food projects and understanding how we come together through food in a non-hierarchical structure has been important since the beginning of the project. As a response to the profit-focused global food model, this project presents an opportunity to rebuild the local food system. Additionally, based on my work here, I believe that a democratically controlled local food system is the direction we have to go if we want to avoid similar profit-focused food in the future. Finally, triple bottom line business is a bridge between this capitalistic, profit-focused food system and the sustainable, accessible food system we are trying to build. Our current western world has been hijacked politically, socially and environmentally by a dominant class of the super-rich who over decades have accumulated more wealth at the cost of ecological and social damage. Farming and triple bottom line business presents an opportunity to rebuild without completely destroying the past foundations of modern civilization.

This major paper explores the role that settler colonization has had in the ongoing struggles of local Aboriginal communities in Toronto. In order to explore arguments for Aboriginal rights in the city, the main research questions that this paper addresses are: What does urban Aboriginal self-determination look like? What can a closer examination of Toronto’s Indigenous and colonial history tell us about the context of present day  urban Aboriginal struggles in the city? How can Torontonians move beyond the politics of relying on settler recognition of Aboriginal rights and towards a multilateral form of development on Indigenous land? By framing this paper around the argument that Indigenous sovereignty precedes - and therefore could not flow from - the politics of recognition between the Canadian and Indigenous nations, this project attempts to transgress boundaries that some might consider settled in Toronto.\n
As more and more individuals are moving to and living in cities, the mental health burden of illness is rising, having individual, social and economic ramifications across the entire population (Srivastava, 2009). This raises the question of how to prevent, mitigate or reduce the effects of urban stress on individuals living in cities as the population continues to rise.\n\nThis question was approached within the context the Credit River Watershed. 107 household surveys were administered in two contrasting urban neighbourhoods to discern the habits of respondents with regards to attending different types of natural spaces, and how relaxing those spaces are. These responses showed that overall, respondents found blue space, i.e. being near water features like rivers, ponds, and lakes, to be the most relaxing of all types of space, followed by looking out of windows at natural spaces, and private green space.\n\nFactor analysis was conducted on the responses of how relaxing different natural spaces are. This revealed four different factors within the data, which have been named “Self-Reported State of Mental Well-being,” “Wilderness and Personal Spaces,” “Designed Spaces,” and “Relaxing Activities.” These factors, excluding the “Self-Reported State of Mental Well-being” factor, were used in designing an Environmental Index of Mental Well-being (EIMWB), which could be used as a way of monitoring the impact of environmental management on mental well-being over time.\n\nThe information from EIMWB monitoring and other data about the effects of natural spaces on mental well-being could be used together within the context of mental health promotion. Due to the more subjective nature of data connecting mental health with the environment, mental health promotion has not been embraced fully by public health agencies, where most health promotion strategies arepositioned. Assuming that the requirement for hard scientific data will not be changed, alternativevenues within which to place mental health promotion should be considered. This paper thus concludes that environmental management and design within urban areas can provide a setting for environmentally-based mental health promotion.\n
This Major Paper provides a historical analysis of the formation and development of CARF-International, a prominent private accreditation body in the social and human services sector. Accreditation is a system of evaluation, whereby organizations or programs are reviewed based on an established set of standards, in order to become approved, or ‘accredited’. Private accreditation, and specifically CARF accreditation, has become mandated and recognized by numerous government agencies across North America, and often acts as a requirement for human/social service agencies to access government funding. However the history and evolution of accreditation, and specifically accrediting institutions in the social/human services sector is not well research, therefore the purpose of this paper is exploratory.\n\nThe paper begins with an overview of the literature on accreditation, accrediting institutions, as well as select literature on policy trends in public management, the welfare state, and transnational private regulation. The research is accomplished through a historical case study methodology that draws loosely on research questions utilized in previous research on accrediting institutions. I have identified three broad phases in the evolution of CARF-International: the foundational years (late 1960s to late 80s); building the market (1990s); and growth and expansion (2000s onwards).\n\nThrough the analysis I have identified seven key themes that relate the literature review to the evolution of CARF-International: the initial purpose of developing standards and accreditation; accreditation as private regulation; governance structure; CARF as a forum for debate; competition between accrediting institutions; the international ‘turn’; and program evaluation. One point of interest is the position of CARF in a governance network (or ‘infrastructure’/’assemblage’) that crosses traditional boundaries of public-private or local-global. A second point is the changing nature of CARF as an institution—specifically in terms of industry involvement in the governance of CARF—as well as the influence of increasing competition and pressure for growth on the practices of CARF as an institution. A third point for further inquiry questions the impact of accreditation on \nservice providers, and service delivery systems.\n\nOverall this Major  Paper offers an  in-depth look at  CARF as an accrediting  institution  as  a  means  to  expose  and  explore  trends  in accreditation and the broader field of social and human services.\n
"In expanding my theoretical and practical knowledge in fostering successful collaborative learning opportunities, my major project is an example of participatory arts-based action research. I was e nthusiastically inspired to incorporate collaborative design and an active painting process into this research project, as I have been an avid community-oriented artist since a tender age. I was able to enhance my range of skills through large scale set design projects, municipal banners, graphic design projects, constructive sculpture, advanced painting, and drawing practices within my undergraduate degree in Geography and Visual Arts at Vancouver Island University. I am an advocate for the diversification of cultural development to encourage creativity and to increase our perceptive sensibilities.  Individuals can achieve an internalized understanding of a particular area of study if they are fully  engaged in the process, thus making the experience more influential.\n\nBy conducting interdisciplinary research in the form of a literature review of contemporary agricultural development, environmental philosophy, and popular education theory, I designed my major project to concentrate on communicating the urgency of socio-cultural and environmental justice embedded within transnational food sovereignty issues. Raj Patel (2009) describes in the Journal of Peasant Studies how a heavy “technocentric approach could exacerbate current conditions of poverty and inequity” due to a concentration of “power and privilege” within a “narrow set of world views at the expense of pertinent local knowledge and socio-cultural and political specificities” (693). The rapid growth of global agricultural development and lack of transnational education pertaining to ecological studies has greatly influenced cultural development, consumer behaviouralism, and expanding corporate ownership. There is an increase in the fragmentation of ecological stability within agricultural productionawell as a lack of ethical responsibility within the cultivation, distribution, manufacturing, and trade practices. In providing participant questionnaires and facilitating a collaborative mural project within my research, this series of popular education workshops aided in expressing sustainable cultural and educational activities. The results from the workshops encapsulated the diversity of perceptions participants had of contemporary agricultural and ecological development.\n\n“They dreamed of an open, democratic education, one that would instill in their children a taste for questioning, a passion for knowledge, a healthy curiosity, the joy of creating, and the \npleasure of risk without which there can be no creation”(Freire, P., 2012, 122).\n\nPaulo Freire (1921-1997) and his work as an educational theorist, influential author, and philosopher, has been a significant influence in the expansion of my own academic and personal \nideologies. Upon developing this major research project, similarly to the progressive topics expressed in the writings on popular education and social justice of Paulo Freire, the purpose was to inspire critical thought, conversation, and creativity. I aimed to build cohesive interconnectivity, inter- relationality, and environmentalist phenomenological perspectives \nrelative to ' just sustainability'. The “crisis of sustainability”, as quoted by Robert Costanza (1987) in David Orr's Hope Is an Imperative, is more of a rational behavioural situation, a social trap, and a cultural avoidance tactic (Orr, 2011, 75). Additionally, Julian Agyeman (2003) within his text Just Sustainabilities: Development in an Unequal World describes just sustainability as recognizing vast societal inequalities with references to ""anthropocentrism”, “ecological democracy”, “feminism and gender”, “selective victimization”, “risk society”, “biocultural assimilation”, and “ecological modernization” (Agyeman, 2003). Just sustainability aims at finding a critical balance between environmental and social justice.\n\nThe organizational world we live in is structured and shaped into systems in all areas including our economies, governments, families, cultures, sciences, and individual selves. It is possible to transition from exclusive systems to more inclusive systems, where we can attempt to actualize our aspirations for “a fair distribution of power, human dignity, and a livable environment” (Merchant, xii, 1992). Within John P. Miller's (2013) text The Holistic Curriculum, he elaborates how our sense of individualism has “promoted the fragmentation as there is less attempt to define the common good, much less work towards such a goal” (pp. 48). Our world has become increasingly homogenized through the process of globalization, as there is a loss of diversity due to monocultural domination as opposed to ensuring the survival of “polycultural praxis” (Gonzalez, 2004, 447). It will require that our contemporary cultures value diversity, cultural sovereignty, and traditional inter-generational values. Within environmental education, to reach a deeper level of collective and collaborative understanding of these developmental issues we must embody the varying local sociocultural contexts, as well as the natural processes of the particular bioregions and ecological systems.\n\nI have also been inspired by a Deep Ecological critical pedagogy of self-realization, as described by author and Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess (1912-2009). Our goal is to enhance our collective understanding of the self, how we determine values, and what spirituality may mean in relation to one another, our communities, our historical nationalities, and our local and global ecological systems. Arne Naess in his interpretation of self-realization stated “the maturity of self has been considered to develop through three stages, from ego to social self, comprising the ego, and from there to the metaphysical self, comprising the social self” while incorporating nature and reaching the critical potential of the “ecological self” (Naess, as quoted in Drengson & Yuichi, 1995, 14). I aimed to include these ideals into a popular educational praxis in a participatory fashion through allowing participants to express themselves within the greater context of our environmentalist topics in a social community in the form of symbolism and artwork.\n\nThe structure of the design loom I developed aimed to empower critical educational dialogue with discussion-based action research and surveys. Topics covered include defining eight definitions: vCulture, Health, Globalization, Deep Ecology, Ecological Stewardship, Sacred Economics, Just Sustainability, and Agroecology (See Ch. 3.2 & Appendix E). The intention of focusing on these terms was to aid in discussing diversity within environmental philosophy, deconstructing the complexity of agricultural studies, developing personal-communal ecological identities, as well as engaging discussions pertaining to fostering healthy sustainable cultures and communities.\n\nThis research design was reviewed and approved by the FES Human Participants Research Committee on behalf of York University for the year 2014. I held two successful workshops in two locations in Toronto, Ontario in May and June of 2014.

This major paper explores the role that settler colonization has had in the ongoing struggles of local Aboriginal communities in Toronto. In order to explore arguments for Aboriginal rights in the city, the main research questions that this paper addresses are: What does urban Aboriginal self-determination look like? What can a closer examination of Toronto’s Indigenous and colonial history tell us about the context of present day  urban Aboriginal struggles in the city? How can Torontonians move beyond the politics of relying on settler recognition of Aboriginal rights and towards a multilateral form of development on Indigenous land?

As more and more individuals are moving to and living in cities, the mental health burden of illness is rising, having individual, social and economic ramifications across the entire population (Srivastava, 2009). This raises the question of how to prevent, mitigate or reduce the effects of urban stress on individuals living in cities as the population continues to rise.\n\nThis question was approached within the context the Credit River Watershed. 107 household surveys were administered in two contrasting urban neighbourhoods to discern the habits of respondents with regards to attending different types of natural spaces, and how relaxing those spaces are. These responses showed that overall, respondents found blue space, i.e. being near water features like rivers, ponds, and lakes, to be the most relaxing of all types of space, followed by looking out of windows at natural spaces, and private green space.\n\nFactor analysis was conducted on the responses of how relaxing different natural spaces are. This revealed four different factors within the data, which have been named “Self-Reported State of Mental Well-being,” “Wilderness and Personal Spaces,” “Designed Spaces,” and “Relaxing Activities.” These factors, excluding the “Self-Reported State of Mental Well-being” factor, were used in designing an Environmental Index of Mental Well-being (EIMWB), which could be used as a way of monitoring the impact of environmental management on mental well-being over time.\n\nThe information from EIMWB monitoring and other data about the effects of natural spaces on mental well-being could be used together within the context of mental health promotion. Due to the more subjective nature of data connecting mental health with the environment, mental health promotion has not been embraced fully by public health agencies, where most health promotion strategies arepositioned. Assuming that the requirement for hard scientific data will not be changed, alternativevenues within which to place mental health promotion should be considered. This paper thus concludes that environmental management and design within urban areas can provide a setting for environmentally-based mental health promotion.\n
This Major Paper provides a historical analysis of the formation and development of CARF-International, a prominent private accreditation body in the social and human services sector. Accreditation is a system of evaluation, whereby organizations or programs are reviewed based on an established set of standards, in order to become approved, or ‘accredited’. Private accreditation, and specifically CARF accreditation, has become mandated and recognized by numerous government agencies across North America, and often acts as a requirement for human/social service agencies to access government funding. However the history and evolution of accreditation, and specifically accrediting institutions in the social/human services sector is not well research, therefore the purpose of this paper is exploratory.\n\nThe paper begins with an overview of the literature on accreditation, accrediting institutions, as well as select literature on policy trends in public management, the welfare state, and transnational private regulation. The research is accomplished through a historical case study methodology that draws loosely on research questions utilized in previous research on accrediting institutions. I have identified three broad phases in the evolution of CARF-International: the foundational years (late 1960s to late 80s); building the market (1990s); and growth and expansion (2000s onwards).\n\nThrough the analysis I have identified seven key themes that relate the literature review to the evolution of CARF-International: the initial purpose of developing standards and accreditation; accreditation as private regulation; governance structure; CARF as a forum for debate; competition between accrediting institutions; the international ‘turn’; and program evaluation. One point of interest is the position of CARF in a governance network (or ‘infrastructure’/’assemblage’) that crosses traditional boundaries of public-private or local-global. A second point is the changing nature of CARF as an institution—specifically in terms of industry involvement in the governance of CARF—as well as the influence of increasing competition and pressure for growth on the practices of CARF as an institution. A third point for further inquiry questions the impact of accreditation on \nservice providers, and service delivery systems.\n\nOverall this Major  Paper offers an  in-depth look at  CARF as an accrediting  institution  as  a  means  to  expose  and  explore  trends  in accreditation and the broader field of social and human services.\n
"In expanding my theoretical and practical knowledge in fostering successful collaborative learning opportunities, my major project is an example of participatory arts-based action research. I was e nthusiastically inspired to incorporate collaborative design and an active painting process into this research project, as I have been an avid community-oriented artist since a tender age. I was able to enhance my range of skills through large scale set design projects, municipal banners, graphic design projects, constructive sculpture, advanced painting, and drawing practices within my undergraduate degree in Geography and Visual Arts at Vancouver Island University. I am an advocate for the diversification of cultural development to encourage creativity and to increase our perceptive sensibilities.  Individuals can achieve an internalized understanding of a particular area of study if they are fully  engaged in the process, thus making the experience more influential.\n\nBy conducting interdisciplinary research in the form of a literature review of contemporary agricultural development, environmental philosophy, and popular education theory, I designed my major project to concentrate on communicating the urgency of socio-cultural and environmental justice embedded within transnational food sovereignty issues. Raj Patel (2009) describes in the Journal of Peasant Studies how a heavy “technocentric approach could exacerbate current conditions of poverty and inequity” due to a concentration of “power and privilege” within a “narrow set of world views at the expense of pertinent local knowledge and socio-cultural and political specificities” (693). The rapid growth of global agricultural development and lack of transnational education pertaining to ecological studies has greatly influenced cultural development, consumer behaviouralism, and expanding corporate ownership. There is an increase in the fragmentation of ecological stability within agricultural productionawell as a lack of ethical responsibility within the cultivation, distribution, manufacturing, and trade practices. In providing participant questionnaires and facilitating a collaborative mural project within my research, this series of popular education workshops aided in expressing sustainable cultural and educational activities. The results from the workshops encapsulated the diversity of perceptions participants had of contemporary agricultural and ecological development.\n\n“They dreamed of an open, democratic education, one that would instill in their children a taste for questioning, a passion for knowledge, a healthy curiosity, the joy of creating, and the \npleasure of risk without which there can be no creation”(Freire, P., 2012, 122).\n\nPaulo Freire (1921-1997) and his work as an educational theorist, influential author, and philosopher, has been a significant influence in the expansion of my own academic and personal \nideologies. Upon developing this major research project, similarly to the progressive topics expressed in the writings on popular education and social justice of Paulo Freire, the purpose was to inspire critical thought, conversation, and creativity. I aimed to build cohesive interconnectivity, inter- relationality, and environmentalist phenomenological perspectives \nrelative to ' just sustainability'. The “crisis of sustainability”, as quoted by Robert Costanza (1987) in David Orr's Hope Is an Imperative, is more of a rational behavioural situation, a social trap, and a cultural avoidance tactic (Orr, 2011, 75). Additionally, Julian Agyeman (2003) within his text Just Sustainabilities: Development in an Unequal World describes just sustainability as recognizing vast societal inequalities with references to ""anthropocentrism”, “ecological democracy”, “feminism and gender”, “selective victimization”, “risk society”, “biocultural assimilation”, and “ecological modernization” (Agyeman, 2003). Just sustainability aims at finding a critical balance between environmental and social justice.\n\nThe organizational world we live in is structured and shaped into systems in all areas including our economies, governments, families, cultures, sciences, and individual selves. It is possible to transition from exclusive systems to more inclusive systems, where we can attempt to actualize our aspirations for “a fair distribution of power, human dignity, and a livable environment” (Merchant, xii, 1992). Within John P. Miller's (2013) text The Holistic Curriculum, he elaborates how our sense of individualism has “promoted the fragmentation as there is less attempt to define the common good, much less work towards such a goal” (pp. 48). Our world has become increasingly homogenized through the process of globalization, as there is a loss of diversity due to monocultural domination as opposed to ensuring the survival of “polycultural praxis” (Gonzalez, 2004, 447). It will require that our contemporary cultures value diversity, cultural sovereignty, and traditional inter-generational values. Within environmental education, to reach a deeper level of collective and collaborative understanding of these developmental issues we must embody the varying local sociocultural contexts, as well as the natural processes of the particular bioregions and ecological systems.\n\nI have also been inspired by a Deep Ecological critical pedagogy of self-realization, as described by author and Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess (1912-2009). Our goal is to enhance our collective understanding of the self, how we determine values, and what spirituality may mean in relation to one another, our communities, our historical nationalities, and our local and global ecological systems. Arne Naess in his interpretation of self-realization stated “the maturity of self has been considered to develop through three stages, from ego to social self, comprising the ego, and from there to the metaphysical self, comprising the social self” while incorporating nature and reaching the critical potential of the “ecological self” (Naess, as quoted in Drengson & Yuichi, 1995, 14). I aimed to include these ideals into a popular educational praxis in a participatory fashion through allowing participants to express themselves within the greater context of our environmentalist topics in a social community in the form of symbolism and artwork.\n\nThe structure of the design loom I developed aimed to empower critical educational dialogue with discussion-based action research and surveys. Topics covered include defining eight definitions: vCulture, Health, Globalization, Deep Ecology, Ecological Stewardship, Sacred Economics, Just Sustainability, and Agroecology (See Ch. 3.2 & Appendix E). The intention of focusing on these terms was to aid in discussing diversity within environmental philosophy, deconstructing the complexity of agricultural studies, developing personal-communal ecological identities, as well as engaging discussions pertaining to fostering healthy sustainable cultures and communities.\n\nThis research design was reviewed and approved by the FES Human Participants Research Committee on behalf of York University for the year 2014. I held two successful workshops in two locations in Toronto, Ontario in May and June of 2014. Participant involvement in these workshops varied depending on personal availability and one's desired contribution to this major research. Participants were given the opportunity to contribute to a group discussion, a 'People's Dictionary' popular education activity, a personal anonymously documented questionnaire, as well as collaborative mural design and painting. This study was completely voluntary and participants had the right to withdraw at any time. This collaborative arts-based action research project was an exciting activity to facilitate, as it gave participants an opportunity to share their stories and opinions, as well as elaborate upon their knowledge of agricultural and ecological studies while exercising their creative skill sets.\n\nThe content within the research interview questionnaire (Appendix C) was relative to each participant's personal contribution to the greater systems of agricultural development, their own moral value-based criteria associated with consumer products, dietary requirements or habits, and lastly if they had any relative practical/educational experience in agricultural production or ecological systems knowledge. Within rapidly globalizing urban cultures, an increasing fragmentation between nature and society can occur. More specifically, there can be a growing lack of transparency in relation to the origin, composition, and accurate social implications of our consumables, as well as to the integrity of environmental health. We are expanding our agricultural production rates, though the margins of inaccessibility are increasing: “Last year record numbers of the world’s poor experienced hunger, this at a time of record harvests and record profits for the world’s major agrifood corporations” (Holt- Gimenez, 2009, 143). There is an increase in transnational corporate ownership of agricultural land and development, consequently a decrease in diversity, an increase in demand, and a lack of proper equitable distribution.\n\nOur cultures and systems are continually evolving, this contemporary post-colonial developmental trend is due to “ecological imperialism”, a term coined by Alfred W. Crosby (1986), which describes the transformation of our physical, biological, atmospheric, and fluvial systems, as well as traditional societal structures and practices (Ashcroft, Griffiths, & Tiffin, 2007, 76). Similarly, the exponential rate of globalization has fostered an expanding global economic structure, while these developmental impacts have “perpetuated poverty, widened material inequalities, increased ecological degradation, sustained militarism, fragmented communities, marginalized subordinated groups, fed intolerance and deepened crises of democracy” (Scholte, 1996, as quoted in Ashcroft, Griffiths, & Tiffin, 2007, 111). Though we claim to be fostering values of social justice, there are barriers to equality and a diminishing sense of responsibility on a global scale. We continue to disassociate ourselves from the biogeographical origins of our ingredients and natural resources, as well as the labour force and communities who increase the opportunities for prosperity and sociocultural innovation in developed urban regions.\n\nPrimarily within my research, I obtained a substantial spectrum of anonymous data from my participant groups to assess the level of interest, intention, and awareness one may have of contemporary transnational agricultural and ecological issues. In a progressive lens, I aimed to inspire participants to broaden their imaginative minds and critical perspectives within the framework of an artistic practice. With literary, energetic, vocal, and creative contributions, I hope their experiences were positive on personal-communal, existential, and internal levels.\n\nIn fostering environmental stewardship and ecological literacy we are searching for “patterns, unity, and connections between people of all ages, races, nationalities, and generations” as well as between people and the natural world; embellishing a “tradition grounded in the belief that life is sacred and not to be carelessly expended on the ephemeral” (Orr, 2011, 260). As Gary Snyder (1990) once described in his article 'Ecology, Place, and the Awakening of Compassion' that an “ecosystem is a kind of mandala in which there are multiple relations that are all powerful and instructive”, while it can be described as hierarchical in terms of “energy-flow”, its basis relies on all entities as being equal and a part of a whole (Snyder, 1990, as quoted in Drengson & Inoue, 1995, 238). Our interwoven interconnectivity is a metaphysical and existential symbiotic system, similar to the sociopolitical ecologies we weave within the constraints of nature, therefore we must maximize our conscientious awareness of these intimate relationships.\n"
Food waste is increasingly being characterized as a prominent global problem. Along with the significant environmental and financial impacts associated with food waste, perhaps more troubling is the phenomenon’s global persistence in spite of worldwide hunger. Despite growing  recognition of the issue, however, research on food waste has remained limited and effective reduction strategies have not been achieved. \n\nThis paper contributes to the development of a comprehensive body of food waste research, conducted as a case study on food waste within Ontario’s domestic fresh strawberry supply chain for the years 2008 to 2012, inclusive. It presents quantitative and qualitative analyses of the occurrence and perceived causes of food waste, based on informationPsynthesis from a review of comparable food waste studies and surveys administered to supply chain actors. The recent removal of Ontario’s grading standards also provides a unique opportunity to assess historical assumptions concerning government grading standards as key mediators of waste generation.\n\nThe results indicate that 56% of edible strawberries grown in Ontario, by volume, are wasted through the course of the supply chain. The percentage estimates of strawberries wasted at each stage are: 15% during agricultural production; 11% during postPharvest handling and distribution; 9% during retail; and 35% during consumption. From a comparative standpoint, consumers are most contributive to waste, while retailers are least. The causes of food waste have been categorized into several areas: biophysical factors, technical factors, issues of mismanagement, regulatory factors, behavioural factors, and the dynamics of supplierPretailer relationships. In particular, increasing importP reliance and the dominance of food retailers are each of significant influence. Incremental strategies for food waste reduction and prevention are here presented in terms of the efficiencyPsubstitutionPredesign (ESR) framework. Overall, strategies addressing food waste are considered to be part of a more general transformative movement towards a food system that is ecologically sustainable, healthPoriented, and equitable.\n
With regards to community farms the Cavaleiro Farm design was approached as a multifunctional design with a strong patterning of environmental, social and economic layers of thinking. Natural education was explored through the development of the workshops and format for visitors to the farm. The innovative green business objective was an overarching theme to this design process because it plays such a large role in making the Cavaleiro Farm project viable. Resilient organizational structures were very much reflected in the social component of this research which of course is strongly interdependent with environment and business development for the project. Food systems, agroecology, food sovereignty and the complexity of our relationship with food have informed this final project. Specifically, various case studies, examples from working farms, as well as experiences interacting with others in the sector have been invaluable in informing this project as Cavaleiro Farm, where the project took place, is a real farm with real people.\n\nLearning organizations, particularly through the lens of systems-thinking and organizational ecology were the research areas that interested me throughout my masters’ work. The mechanics of how people work together on food projects and understanding how we come together through food in a non-hierarchical structure has been important since the beginning of the project. As a response to the profit-focused global food model, this project presents an opportunity to rebuild the local food system. Additionally, based on my work here, I believe that a democratically controlled local food system is the direction we have to go if we want to avoid similar profit-focused food in the future. Finally, triple bottom line business is a bridge between this capitalistic, profit-focused food system and the sustainable, accessible food system we are trying to build. Our current western world has been hijacked politically, socially and environmentally by a dominant class of the super-rich who over decades have accumulated more wealth at the cost of ecological and social damage. Farming and triple bottom line business presents an opportunity to rebuild without completely destroying the past foundations of modern civilization.
